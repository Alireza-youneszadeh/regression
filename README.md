the code contains single linear regression algorithm which is a scratch code so that the basis of linear regression has been shown.
there is only one feature and an output that corresponds to each other with linear function and the goal is to fit linear function to training data by optimizing the cost function.
it has been attempted to use basic formula to make a sense what is behind the scene in linear regression.
the dataset to implement regression  has been attached so that it's possible to download  and apply it to code.
